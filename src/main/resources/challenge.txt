1. Compute stats for each team
- % of games won (home, away, total)
- Number of goals scored vs. number of goals conceded
- Points scored (0 = loss, 1 = Draw, 3 = Win)
- Which teams were better in the first half vs. second half?

2. Create a 20x20 matrix of all results
- Win / Draw / Loss for each matchup
- Goals scored
- Other interesting stats?

3. Advanced: Time series of results (by week?)
- Points total for each team over time
- Ranking for each team over time
- How did bookmaker’s odds evolve over time for each team?
